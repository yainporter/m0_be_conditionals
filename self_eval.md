# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- Conditionals are useful when you are trying to find out if a statement is either true or false.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- I would try to write my code shorter, and maybe run the code in the terminal with VS Code instead of irb.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- As I was completing each activity, I started to realize that one of the last lines of codes aren't needed because if almost every possible outcome was already written, then that only leaves one result, so I can just automatically print the response. It brought me a lot of satisfaction to realize that because it means that I can be more efficient in writing my code and be less redundant.
